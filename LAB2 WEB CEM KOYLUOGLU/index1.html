                        All my friends and classmates are very active people. We like camping, going for excursions and any outdoor activities. When we stay together we play different sport games. My favorite game is football. I have been playing football since I was 8. This game is just fantastic and I am a big fan of Messi, Beckham and our Russian football players. When I have possibility I go on football matches with my dad and friends. It is very cool and exciting.

                        Football is very popular in my country. We play football at school every week during physical education. What is more when I go out with my friends I also play this game. I can not say I am the best football player, but I usually run a lot and have big experience in scoring goals. I am a captain of the team and I always inspire the guys. I know it can be good or bad game, we can win or lose, but for me only the fact of the game is important and interesting. We are friends and we know it’s just a game.

Football gives me a lot of energy and power. I never feel tired even after 2-3 hours of running. This is the way how I communicate with my friends and I can even meet new people. Very often the other boys come to us and ask to join the game. It’s always a pleasure for me.

Football is a great sport game. I move a lot, I concentrate my attention and I am in contact all the time. Thanks to these things my body is fit and I feel excellent.

Children, teenagers and adults adore to play football in my country. Girls don’t understand this game, but I know only real men play football.

Who knows maybe one day I will become a popular football player. I would like to have this career in future and do the thing that I like so much. I know many guys like to play football, but for me it’s not just a hobby. Football is my lifestyle and I would play this game every day.
